# Responsibilities

My area of responsibility is vulnerability scanning software. It schedules vulnerability scans of customers' infrastructure, collects scan reports from scanners, parses the reports and puts the discovered vulnerabilities in the vulnerabilities database.

I am also responsible for supporting some legacy software systems *(web service management)*.


# Nature of software

The scanning backend that I work on is a large distributed application that consists of several microservices. 


# Most interesting project
