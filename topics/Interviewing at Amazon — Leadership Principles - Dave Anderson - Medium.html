 a bar raiser at Amazon (a little googling will answer what that is if 
you’re not aware), I’ve gotten the opportunity to interview a lot of 
people. I’ve interviewed both very senior and very junior folks. Bar 
raisers do interview across all job families, and I’ve interviewed 
people for some pretty crazy positions. However, most of my interviews 
are for technical positions. Jobs like technical program managers, 
software development managers, quality engineers/managers, and of course
 the highest volume: software development engineers.</p><p id="da4a" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">There
 are plenty of web resources regarding how to pass the functional (job 
skills) part of interviews. In fact, when I have friends and relatives 
interviewing, I send them to the internet to figure out what types of 
questions to prepare for rather than spend my time explaining. This type
 of preparing is pretty straight forward. You need to be good at your 
job, and make certain that the functional knowledge about your job is 
pretty fresh in your head. Perhaps how Hashtables work, or a bit about 
K-means clustering.</p><p id="389b" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">On
 the other hand, there isn’t much on the internet about the other side 
of the interview process. When we at Amazon interview candidates, we’re 
looking for a combination of those functional skills (coding, design, 
program management, 3D modeling.. you name it), and leadership skills. 
This applies to every potential new hire at Amazon, from experienced 
vice presidents to brand new college graduates. We literally assign 
specific <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/principles" class="bb cn le lf lg lh" target="_blank">Amazon leadership principles</a>
 to each interviewer in the process. Those interviewers attempt to get a
 picture of how likely you are to be the type of leader we’re looking 
for.</p><p id="544c" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">This
 article was written for the specific purpose of preparing you (a little
 bit) for that half of the interview. It’s my version of giving sample 
questions. I don’t know what you’ll be asked, but I know what we’re 
looking for. If you can be what we’re looking for, we’d love to have 
you.</p><h1 id="ff59" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Amazon Leadership Culture</h1><p id="9f22" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc">There
 are quite a few articles out there about what Amazon’s leadership is 
like, how our leaders act, and what it’s like to work at Amazon. There 
are mentions of continual innovation, cut-throat competition, and fast 
paced projects.</p><p id="f6a9" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">As
 an Amazonian, what I always tell candidates is that there is not much 
about working at Amazon which is consistent across groups. We don’t do 
much the “Amazon way”, because very little is centralized. We have the 
leadership principles which guide how we act. Otherwise, every group 
acts like a little startup. They establish their own processes and best 
practices. They build an organization and way of doing things uniquely 
their own, while still following our leadership principles.</p><p id="9fa9" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Considering
 how little we have centralized, we use the bar raiser group as a type 
of glue across organizations. We select bar raisers from the pool of 
experienced folk at Amazon, not just those who can interview well, but 
more importantly — those who deeply understand our leadership 
principles. As bar raisers, we then try to hire people who can 
understand and act on our principles. Finally, we set them loose into 
the chaos which is Amazon, with an assumption and belief that hiring 
people who follow our leadership principles will lead to long term 
success.</p><h1 id="c3b2" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Understanding the Leadership Principles</h1><p id="2351" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc">When
 I have friends or relatives (or friends of friends, or friends of 
friends of relatives) ask how to prepare for an interview, I always 
suggest they read the description of the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/principles" class="bb cn le lf lg lh" target="_blank">Amazon Leadership Principles</a>,
 and think hard about each of them. More than any company I’ve worked 
with or heard about, we use those principles on a daily basis.</p><p id="f550" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">We
 obviously hire based on the principles. We give both positive and 
negative feedback which reference the principles. We are encouraged to 
be aware of our own successes and failures in relation to the leadership
 principles. I know I’ve certainly referenced a leadership principle or 
two while talking about parenting techniques.</p><p id="6ffd" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">I’ve read many thousands of interview transcripts, and it’s often glaringly obvious which candidates have really read and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok" class="bb cn le lf lg lh" target="_blank">grokked</a>
 what the leadership principles mean, and those who either neglected to 
prepare for their interview, or simply didn’t understand.</p><p id="d4b1" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc"><em class="ld">Note
 for the below sections. The quotes I’m putting in are actual snippets 
of interviews I’ve had, with close to literal quotes. Yes, they’re 
extreme examples. I’m using a blunt instrument to make certain you know 
what I’m talking about.</em></p><p id="f394" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc"><em class="ld">Another quick note before getting into specifics. </em>We
 interviewers are spending our time talking to you — the candidate — in 
hopes that you’ll be hired. It’s a big investment of our time, we don’t 
want you to fail. When we say something like “<em class="ld">Well, that’s a good start, what else?</em>”, it’s very rare that the right answer is “<em class="ld">Um.. nope, that’s it</em>”. Please listen carefully to what your interviewer is saying. Again, we’re here to help :)</p><h1 id="cc91" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Customer Obsession</h1><p id="31ef" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc"><em class="ld">Leaders
 start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to 
earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to 
competitors, they obsess over customers.</em></p><p id="872b" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Always
 one of the favorites to include in interview loops. I suspect as a 
principle it strikes so many candidates as obvious that they don’t 
realize what we’re really getting at. Every decision of consequence at 
Amazon involves the customer. Not just how they’ll react, but what is 
actually best for them.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="7fa8" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">What factors would you consider when deciding which offer should win the buy-box on the retail website?</p><p id="c093" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc"><em class="bs">“Maximize profit</em>”</p><p id="d851" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">What else would you consider?</p><p id="0210" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">Volume of sales, conversion rate, margin, etc, but it all comes back to profit.</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="b07d" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">When
 interviewing research scientists for example (per the above), I’ve had 
some repeatedly insist that the right thing to do is to use algorithms 
to maximize profit. Even when I give a hint such as “<em class="ld">What unintended consequence might happen if you only optimized for profit?</em>”, they often miss the customer experience ramifications.</p><p id="2e6f" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">The
 thing we’re looking for is that you consider and care about the 
customer. We’ve regularly made decisions at Amazon which lowered 
profit/sales, because it was the right thing to do for customers. We all
 understand that the company performs better if our customers (and our 
employees) believe it’s acting in our best interest. We believe that’s 
the right thing to do, we make those decisions all the time, and we 
reward people for it. We need to make sure new hires will do the same 
thing.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="0c7e" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">For that feature, who was the customer?</p><p id="357d" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">The product management team gave us requirements.”</em></p><p id="179e" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">But who was the end customer?</p><p id="1353" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">Well, the marketing team I suppose, because they wanted marketing slots. Oh! And the sales group too.</em>”</p><p id="9140" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">But who was the customer?</p><p id="b98c" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">I don’t understand</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="a9b6" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">It’s
 somewhat shocking how often people buried in large companies don’t 
mentally identify their customer as the final external customer. Their 
customer is their boss, sales, marketing, etc. They are so focused on 
doing what they’re told, so focused on building what they’re asked, 
without taking a big step back to understand who uses their product.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="0470" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc"><em class="bs">“I
 wrote the contact-us form for customer questions, but then I was 
watching the questions coming in (out of curiosity), and I saw so many 
of the questions had easy answers. I added a simple FAQ at the top of 
the contact form — after asking the product lead if she minded. It 
reduced usage of my form by a lot, which I’d call a win.</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="758c" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">We
 don’t need you to exhibit our leadership principles at your current job
 (we understand that other companies are different), but we do expect 
you to be able to demonstrate customer obsession in your answers. 
Preferably you’ll know who your customer is, their needs, what they 
really want from you (outside of your specific tasks), and think about 
solving their needs, not just tasks.</p><h1 id="5c9d" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Ownership</h1><p id="56e4" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc"><em class="ld">Leaders
 are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value 
for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond
 just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job”.</em></p><p id="d00b" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">This
 is perhaps my favorite principle, because I think it is so core to how 
Amazon operates internally. You can be confident that you’ll be asked 
questions to assess if you can act and think as an owner. This 
leadership principle is core to defining how our groups and company is 
organized. Slight digression to help you understand our model.</p><p id="d05a" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">At
 Amazon, almost every organization / team / person can identify with 
something(s) they own. For example, I currently own the technology for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I499BNA/" class="bb cn le lf lg lh" target="_blank">Amazon FreeTime</a>.
 By definition, that means all technology decisions related to the

to ensure it’s competitive (and almost always cheaper) than doing things
 on your own. Amazon devices (such as our tablets) are shockingly cheap 
compared to the value they provide. Amazon retail is well known for 
valuing low prices and pursues efficiency aggressively. This principle 
is all about ensuring that we can provide as much value for as little 
cost as possible.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="776c" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Why did you get into an argument with him?</p><p id="a05c" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">Because
 he didn’t give us enough people for the project. I told him it needed 5
 people, and he said he’d give me 2. I said things cost what they cost, 
and if he won’t pay, we won’t do the work.</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="7225" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Things
 never cost what they cost, because we can always do less, do it 
cheaper, do it slower, do it with lower quality. We always have options.
 We almost never have the resources we feel we “<em class="ld">need</em>”
 at Amazon. And that does amazing things for the products we build. I 
know the process can frustrate people, but pay attention to the language
 in the principle. We’re <strong class="kr md">inventing </strong>to solve problems in a cheaper way. Which often is faster, easier to maintain, easier to extend, etc.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="f451" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Then how did you fix the lead generation tool?</p><p id="dcd4" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">Actually
 we really didn’t have the time to maintain it or rebuild it, but they 
really needed a tool to track their work. I realized that our bug 
tracking system had most of the features they needed. Certainly wasn’t 
perfect, but I explained how they could use it, and it worked out fine. 
One less system to maintain.</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="1b62" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">When
 you’re interviewing, we’re looking for you to understand that having 
not enough time or resources is a fine and expected thing. Having too 
much to do, and too little time is perfectly ok. Not doing everything 
you want on a project is healthy, because doing everything you ever 
wanted to do is inefficient. The last thing on your stack rank will 
never be done, and we should all be happy with that.</p><h1 id="6a18" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Earn Trust</h1><p id="76fb" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc"><em class="ld">Leaders
 listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They
 are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or 
embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor 
smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the
 best.</em></p><p id="b149" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">The most commonly missed aspect of this principle is the “<em class="ld">vocally self-critical</em>”
 aspect. Probably because when you’re interviewing and telling us how 
awesome you are, you might feel challenged to explain that you’re not 
awesome all the time. However, with big power comes big responsibility. 
It’s very important for a leader to be able to recognize when they’ve 
made a mistake, so that they can correct it quickly. This “<em class="ld">earns trust</em>” with co-workers, as well as ensures that future mistakes can be corrected quickly.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="7f8a" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Tell me about a time you made a serious mistake at work.</p><p id="b62c" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">Hmm..

However, it might not be as instructional as I need.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="886c" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Tell me how that project you were leading failed.</p><p id="21bd" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">Well,
 the product manager had given us the wrong requirements, and then one 
of my engineers screwed up the metrics gathering. Then when we launched,
 marketing didn’t notice it was under-performing, and kept advertising 
the broken product.</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="5014" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">We expect leaders to always recognize that they have the power to improve things. It was someone else’s decision? <em class="ld">Then you failed to influence them</em>. It was someone else’s error? <em class="ld">You failed to notice the mistake fast enough</em>. When you’re explaining a mistake, first recognize your own, before explaining other misses.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="98e6" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">How did the marketing team send the emails to the wrong people?</p><p id="a24a" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">Well,
 first we didn’t give them the necessary tools, so they were forced to 
rely on manual mail merges. It wasn’t fair to expect them to avoid 
errors. My team should have warned them about the risks, and we could 
have built better tools.. in fact, we’re in the process of building them
 now.</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="08cf" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">The
 best leaders look dispassionately at the details of a situation and 
address it as a leader at Amazon. It’s not about pointing blame, it’s 
about fixing processes. Mechanisms for the long term rather than being 
focused on the short term incident.</p><p id="6f4b" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">As
 an interviewer, think carefully about how you deal with mistakes, both 
yours and others. We care about long term, not short. We care about 
fixing problems, not blaming. We care about honesty, not a story. We 
care about respecting those we work with, because we’re going to work 
together for a long time. Partially because we’re so decentralized, it’s
 critical that we trust those who we work with, because each of us have a
 lot of power and responsibility.</p><h1 id="96f4" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Dive Deep</h1><p id="c246" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc"><em class="ld">Leaders

them.</em></p><p id="7f7c" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc"><em class="ld">“Trust yet verify” </em>is
 a favorite phrase at Amazon. We care deeply that leaders keep a careful
 eye on what they own, and know ways to audit their space. If something 
doesn’t make sense, our leaders need to have the ability (and interest) 
to dive in and figure out what’s going on.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="43a3" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Your team reduced latency on the website?

 not suggesting that you claim knowledge over every detail of what you 
or your teams have worked on, but I will say that you shouldn’t tell a 
story where you don’t know the most obvious of details. If you increased
 traffic, you better know what you did. If you dropped error rates, you 
should know what the errors were. We care that people know details, 
because it means they cared enough to question things. We need curious 
and skeptical leaders.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="144c" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">How did you reduce the memory footprint?</p><p id="e6f7" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">It’s
 funny, we had to restart our system every few months because of a 
memory leak. I’d just joined the team, and the mystery annoyed me. So I 
spent a few hours reading very carefully through our memory management 
code, and realized that we incorrectly double-parsing in one of our 
helper functions. Not only did it save on memory, but CPU as well. It’d 
been there for years.</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="2c27" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">I
 love when I ask questions of people, and they can go 4 or 5 levels 
deep, and keep getting more excited because the details are actually 
interesting to them.</p><h1 id="bef3" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</h1><p id="a301" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc"><em class="ld">Leaders
 are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, 
even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have 
conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of 
social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.</em></p><p id="73bc" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">I
 particularly love this principle because I feel it’s such a clear 
departure from the natural culture at other companies. I believe this is
 true, because in interviews I’ve been in, one of the most common quotes
 is “<em class="ld">Because my boss said so</em>”. We never find it 
acceptable to do something because your boss said to. We do things 
because it’s the decision we’ve made, and with the data we’ve gathered, 
we’ve committed to that plan.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="b05a" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc"><em class="bs">“My
 boss had insisted that React Native wasn’t responsive enough for our 
interface, so I made a quick prototype of our UI and showed him how it 
was just as responsive as our existing product.”</em></p></blockquote><p id="e5e0" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Data
 based disagreements are great. We use them all the time at Amazon, and 
examples of when you gathered data to make an argument are great. What 
you have to be careful about is that people end up in the realm of 
disagree &amp; disagree (instead of the commit part).</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="9cd8" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc"><em class="bs">“I
 showed my boss that the design wouldn’t work, she refused to listen. I 
explained to the other engineers that it wasn’t my fault if things 
break, which of course they did later.”</em></p></blockquote><p id="1d71" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">As
 a leader, we can never feel (and certainly not express) glee in the 
failure of others. Cheering at others failures suggests that you’re 
playing a zero sum game, and the game is not zero sum within Amazon. We 
believe that we’ll all succeed if we’re all on the same team. “I told 
you so” is never acceptable. We give data, make decisions, and live with
 the consequences as a team.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="91b1" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc"><em class="bs">“I
 showed my boss the data, explained why option B was better, she pushed 
back, I suggested that we could try both options, she still disagreed, 
and asked us to move forward. I told my team we were building option A, 
and made sure to explain why it was the right choice. Because my team 
needs to know that we’re all on the same page.”</em></p></blockquote><p id="668c" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">We
 need leaders who are able to recognize when disagreements are needed, 
and when they’re not. What’s worth arguing about, and what’s not. What’s
 worth escalating, and when it’s time to move on and start delivering. 
And we need to believe that you’re that type of person.</p><h1 id="a2db" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Deliver Results</h1><p id="b1fe" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc"><em class="ld">Leaders

right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to 
the occasion and never settle.</em></p><p id="dcc6" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">In
 the very end, Amazon employees need to deliver value. That one is 
pretty obvious. Take a look at a few key words, which are the ones we 
often dive into in interviews. “<em class="ld">Key Inputs</em>” is a good one. Do you know your key inputs?</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="5ba5" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">How did you know if your registration form was working?</p><p id="e6db" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">If it registered people properly.</em>”</p><p id="348a" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">How might you go about measuring the success of a registration form?</p><p id="b0ad" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">If it doesn’t have errors it’s successful</em>.”</p></blockquote><p id="f500" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">We
 need people to recognize that they’re not accomplishing tasks, they’re 
focusing on inputs for their business. They’re not delivering 
registration forms, they’re delivering pipelines for new customers, 
which have conversion rates and perhaps customer contacts. It is much 
harder (and much better) to focus on the business itself, rather than 
completing tasks.</p><p id="0945" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">Also, <em class="ld">timely fashion</em>, <em class="ld">setbacks</em>, and <em class="ld">never settling</em>.
 We’re somewhat allergic to people being casual about date slips and 
deadlines, because per our earlier discussion around high standards, 
it’s critical that leaders always expect better. While it’s reasonable 
to miss dates (we all do, regularly.. certainly more regularly than 
hitting dates), we also can’t be comfortable with it.</p><blockquote class="ma mb mc"><p id="d276" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">What’d you do after you realized you couldn’t hit the date?</p><p id="64e7" class="kp kq fo ld kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">“<em class="bs">I
 looked at the features, and picked out a few I felt we could cut. The 
product manager agreed on a couple. Then, as bad as it sounds, I 
convinced QA to cut a week off the testing schedule. It was risky, but 
it was so important to hit the holidays. I figured we could test 
everything important, and it was the only way to get out in time.</em>”</p></blockquote><p id="781d" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc">You’ll notice our principle doesn’t say with “<em class="ld">perfect quality</em>”, it says “<em class="ld">right quality</em>”.
 Right quality is often less quality than we’d prefer. Going back to our
 frugality principle, we never have the time or resources to accomplish 
things the way we <strong class="kr md">want</strong>, so we accomplish things the way we <strong class="kr md">need</strong>.
 So before you get yourself too wrapped up insisting on high standards, 
keep in mind that we’re extremely pragmatic. And we’re all about 
delivering the right results.</p><h1 id="e1f9" class="li lj fo bs br gk lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu">Final summary</h1><p id="5377" class="kp kq fo bs kr b ks lv ku lw kw lx ky ly la lz lc">I
 have to say that this ended up longer than I’d intended. I started with
 the intention of writing a quick note (in response to a couple 
particularly bad interviews), but I ended up with something a bit more
